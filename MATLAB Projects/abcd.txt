My school is very good having four storey building. 
It is like a temple where we go daily to study. First of all in the early morning, 
we pray to God for our better study and say good morning to our class teacher. 
Then we start study according to our syllabus. I like to go school daily. 
My school has very strict discipline which we need to follow on regular basis. I like my school dress very much. 
It is situated around 2 km away from my sweet home. I go to school by yellow school bus. 
My school is located at very peaceful place and away from the pollution, noise, dust, noise and smoke of the city.
